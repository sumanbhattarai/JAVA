# Access Modifiers

A Java access modifier specifies which classes can access a given class and its fields, constructors and methods. Access modifiers can be specified separately for a class, its constructors, fields and methods.  Classes, fields, constructors and methods can have one of four different Java access modifiers:

- private
- default (package)
- protected
- public
