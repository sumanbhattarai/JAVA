Constructor

- A constructor initializes an object immediately upon creation.
- Constructor has same name as the class it resides and it syntactically similar to  method.
- NO return type even no void . This is because the implicit return type of a class constructor is the class type itself.
- If no constructor provided , java itself create default constructor and assign default value to the variable.
