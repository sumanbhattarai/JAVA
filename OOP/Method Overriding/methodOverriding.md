- In a class hierarchy , when a method in a subclass has the same name and type signature as a method in its superclass , then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super class .

- When an over ridden method is called from within its subclass , it will always refer to the version of that method defined by the subclass .

- The version of the method defined by the superclass will be hidden .

- If we need to invoke version of superclass , we must use super inside the subclass .
