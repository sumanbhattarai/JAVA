Using Super();

  - Whenever a sub class needs to refer to its immediate superclass , it can do so by use of the keyword super.

  - super() has two general forms :
        1) The first calls the superclass constructor .
        2) IT is used to access a member of the superclass that has been hidden by a member of a subclass .

  - super() must always be the first statement executed inside a subclass constructor .
