# Inner Class

- Java inner class or nested class is a class which is declared inside the class or interface.

- We use inner classes to logically group classes and interfaces in one place so that it can be more readable and maintainable.

- Additionally, it can access all the members of outer class including private data members and methods.

> Syntax of Inner class

    class Java_Outer_class{  

     //code  

     class Java_Inner_class{  

      //code  

     }  
    }  

# Advantage of java inner classes

There are basically three advantages of inner classes in java. They are as follows:

- Nested classes represent a special type of relationship that is it can access all the members (data members and methods) of outer class including private.

- Nested classes are used to develop more readable and maintainable code because it logically group classes and interfaces in one place only.

- Code Optimization: It requires less code to write.
