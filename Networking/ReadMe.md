# Network 

1. A network is a collection of devices that share a common communication protocol and connected with some communication medium.

2. A protocol defines a set of rule to which all the communicating parties adhere to ( agree ).

3. The java.net package was designed with a group of classes and interfaces which not only provide low level but also high level communication details.

4. The java.net package provides support for the two common network protocols .
- TCP ( Transmission Control Protocol )
- UDP ( User Datagram Protocol )

> Differentiate between TCP and UDP .

| TCP | UDP |
|-----|-------|
|Reliable | Unreliable |
|Connection-oriented |	Connectionless|
|Segment re-transmission and flow control through windowing| 	No windowing or re-transmission|
|Segment sequencing |	No sequencing|
|Acknowledge sequencing |	No acknowledgment|


# Network Programming

- The tern network programming refers to writing programs the execute accross multiple devices , in which the devices are all connected to each other using a network. 

``` Some Terminologies ```

> Address : 

- It is a logical address that can be change . IP address are a 32-bit number ( IPV4 format ) , often represented s a quad of four 8-bit number separated by periods. 
            
                    Eg : 192.168.0.1

>  Protocol :

- It is set of rules basically that is followed for communication.

        Eg : TCP , UDP , FTP , POP . SMPT , HTTP . HTTPs

> Port Number :

- The port number is used to uniquely identify different applications . It acts as a communcation end point between applications .

- The Valid port number range from 1 - 65535 .

- The ports upto 1023 are reserved for well known services and hence are well-known ports .

        Eg : 80 fot HTTP , 21 for FTP , 22 for SSH


> Socket :

- A socket is an end point between two way communication. 

- It defines a network connection as a Stream from which bytes can be read and similarly bytes can be sent.

- Java Socket can be used to provide both connection-oriented ( TCP ) as well as connectionless ( UDP ) services .

# Java Socket Programming

- A scoket programming is used for communcation between the application running on different machine.

- Java socket programming support : 

|Connection-Oriented|Connection-less|
|-------------------|---------------|
|Classes Used: | Classes Used :|
| ```1. Socket```| ```1. DatagramSocket```|
|```2. ServerSocket```|```2. DatagramPacket```|


- Client in socket programming must know :

```1. IP Address of Server ```

```2. Port Number ```


# Socket Class 

- This class is used to create a socket . 
 
 > Methods

 - ``` public InputStream getInputStream() ```
 - ``` public OutputStream getOutputStream() ```
 - ``` public Synchronized void close() ```

 # ServerSocket Class

 - This class is used to create a server socket .
 - This object is used to establish communication with the clients .
  
> Methods
- ``` public Socket accept() ```
- ``` public synchronized void close() ```
